    <h1>Russ' Hobbies</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I've enjoyed many different hobbies over the years but some have stuck with me since my teen years, such as my love for Photography
        and using software such as Adobe Photoshop to make images that appeal to people. I hope to incorporate into my web designs skills I 
        have learned over the years to make my web pages more appealing.       
    </p>
    <p>Other hobbies I've had over the years I will list briefly below.
        <ul>
            <li>In my youth I loved to build model cars and even some train cars for model railroads.</li>
            <li>Computers and technology have been a long time hobby since the days of Windows 3.1, actually my first PC was a Timex Sinclair 1000.
                I also had a Commodore 64 home PC and I was amazed at what could be done with 64kb of memory.
            </li>
            <li>A couple of years ago, 2022, I decided I wanted to get into aerial Photography and a friend gave me a drone to practice with. I eventually
                decided to buy my own so I bought a drone and decided to get a Commerical pilots license to fly for profit and to help others.
            </li>
            <li>I am an avid cyclist and have ridden nearly 40,000 miles on two wheel bikes. Even at the age of 70 my friends who I met through cycling still
                try and get at least one 25 mile ride in a week when weather permits. One of our greatest accomplishments on a bicycle was doing the BRAG ride
            Which stands for (Bike Ride Across Georiga). We rode from Rome, GA. in the northwest corner all the way across the north Georgia mountains to
        Lake Hartwell, SC. It was over 600 miles of some of  the steepest hills we had ever ridden.</li>
            <li>For many years I rode motorcycles of all kinds and rode them to work several years and was a member of CMA (Christian Motorcyclists Assoc)</li>
        </ul>
